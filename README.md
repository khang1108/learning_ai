# Overview
Here is my repository used for learning new AI knowledge, such as Deep Learning with [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), Machine Learning, LLMs and NLP. All of the knowledge in this repository I've learned from [Patrick Loeber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c36lUUr864M&t=6466s), [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) and [Stanford Course](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rOY23Y0BoGoBGgQ1zmU_MT_&si=jJ-_vWTPfD4eM7jX)

I want to share the knowledge I've learned from various sources with everyone who needs it. I'm just a second-year student studying Computer Science at [Ho Chi Minh University of Science - VNUHCM](https://hcmus.edu.vn/).

# Installation
To run this repository, you should install some essential packages in Python.

First, you need to install [ipynb](https://pypi.org/project/ipynb/), which is primarily used for importing code from Jupyter Notebook files, which have the .ipynb extension.
```bash
pip install ipynb 
```
Then you need to install crucial packages for manipulating and representing numerical data. 
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib 
```
Finally, PyTorch packages are primarily used for building and deploying deep learning models. Their functionalities encompass a wide range of tasks within the machine learning and artificial intelligence domains.
```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio # for building AI architectures
```
