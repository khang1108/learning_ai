       "\"This Python code presents two distinct functions for calculating the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.\\n\\nThe first function, `sum_of_n_natural_numbers_formula`, leverages the direct mathematical formula `n * (n + 1) / 2`, which offers a highly efficient, constant-time (O(1)) solution.\\n\\nThe second function, `sum_of_n_natural_numbers_loop`, achieves the same result by iteratively adding numbers from 1 to `n` using a `for` loop. This approach has a linear time complexity (O(n)).\\n\\nBoth functions include input validation to ensure `n` is a non-negative integer, returning 0 and printing a warning message if a negative value is provided. The code also includes example usage for both functions to demonstrate their behavior with different inputs, including positive numbers, zero, and negative numbers.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## `sum_of_n_natural_numbers_formula`\\n\\n### Description\\nThis function calculates the sum of the first `n` natural numbers using the well-known mathematical formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `n * (n + 1) / 2`. This method is highly efficient, providing a constant-time (O(1)) solution, making it suitable for very large values of `n`. It handles non-negative integer inputs for `n`, gracefully managing negative inputs by returning 0 and issuing a warning.\\n\\n### Parameters\\n*   `n` (int): The upper limit (inclusive) of the natural numbers to sum. This represents the count of natural numbers to be summed, starting from 1. It is expected to be a non-negative integer.\\n\\n### Returns\\n*   `int`: The calculated sum of the natural numbers from 1 to `n`. Returns 0 if `n` is 0 or any negative value.\\n\\n### Example Usage\\n```python\\n# Sum of the first 5 natural numbers (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5)\\nprint(sum_of_n_natural_numbers_formula(5))\\n# Expected Output: 15\\n\\n# Sum of the first 1 natural number\\nprint(sum_of_n_natural_numbers_formula(1))\\n# Expected Output: 1\\n\\n# Sum of 0 natural numbers\\nprint(sum_of_n_natural_numbers_formula(0))\\n# Expected Output: 0\\n\\n# Sum with a negative 'n'\\nprint(sum_of_n_natural_numbers_formula(-5))\\n# Expected Output: Warning: 'n' should be a non-negative integer. Returning 0.\\n#                  0\\n```\\n\\n### Edge Cases\\n*   **`n = 0`**: The function correctly returns 0, as there are no natural numbers between 1 and 0 to sum. The formula `0 * (0 + 1) // 2` evaluates to 0.\\n*   **`n < 0`**: For any negative `n` (e.g., `n = -5`), the function prints a warning message to the console indicating invalid input and returns 0. The formula for natural numbers is not applicable for negative `n`.\\n*   **Large `n`**: Due to its O(1) time complexity, this formula method is extremely efficient for very large values of `n` (e.g., `n = 1_000_000_000`). Python's arbitrary-precision integers handle the large sums without overflow.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## `sum_of_n_natural_numbers_loop`\\n\\n### Description\\nThis function calculates the sum of the first `n` natural numbers by iteratively adding each integer from 1 up to `n` using a `for` loop. This approach provides a clear, step-by-step way to compute the sum. While correct, its time complexity is linear (O(n)), meaning its execution time increases proportionally with the value of `n`, making it less efficient than the formula method for very large inputs. It also includes input validation for non-negative `n`.\\n\\n### Parameters\\n*   `n` (int): The upper limit (inclusive) of the natural numbers to sum. This represents the count of natural numbers to be summed, starting from 1. It is expected to be a non-negative integer.\\n\\n### Returns\\n*   `int`: The calculated sum of the natural numbers from 1 to `n`. Returns 0 if `n` is 0 or any negative value.\\n\\n### Example Usage\\n```python\\n# Sum of the first 5 natural numbers (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5)\\nprint(sum_of_n_natural_numbers_loop(5))\\n# Expected Output: 15\\n\\n# Sum of the first 1 natural number\\nprint(sum_of_n_natural_numbers_loop(1))\\n# Expected Output: 1\\n\\n# Sum of 0 natural numbers\\nprint(sum_of_n_natural_numbers_loop(0))\\n# Expected Output: 0\\n\\n# Sum with a negative 'n'\\nprint(sum_of_n_natural_numbers_loop(-5))\\n# Expected Output: Warning: 'n' should be a non-negative integer. Returning 0.\\n#                  0\\n```\\n\\n### Edge Cases\\n*   **`n = 0`**: The `range(1, n + 1)` (which becomes `range(1, 1)`) produces an empty sequence. As a result, the loop body does not execute, and `total_sum` remains initialized at 0, which is the correct sum for zero natural numbers.\\n*   **`n < 0`**: For any negative `n` (e.g., `n = -5`), the function prints a warning message and returns 0. The loop-based sum is designed for positive natural numbers.\\n*   **Large `n`**: While functionally correct, this method will become significantly slower for very large values of `n` (e.g., `n = 1_000_000_000`) compared to the formula method because it has to perform `n` additions. Python's arbitrary-precision integers handle the large sums without overflow, but the computation time will increase linearly.\""

       "'The solution provides two Python functions, `sum_of_n_natural_numbers_formula` and `sum_of_n_natural_numbers_loop`, as described. Both functions include robust input validation to ensure `n` is a non-negative integer, printing a warning and returning 0 for invalid inputs.\\n\\nAccompanying these functions is a comprehensive `unittest.TestCase` class, `TestSumNaturalNumbers`, which thoroughly tests both implementations. The test suite covers:\\n\\n1.  **Basic Functionality**: Verifying correct sums for small positive integers (`n=1, 5, 10`).\\n2.  **Edge Cases**: Testing the behavior when `n` is `0`.\\n3.  **Error Cases/Invalid Input**:\\n    *   Testing with negative `n` values (`n=-1, -5`) to ensure a warning message is printed to `sys.stdout` and `0` is returned.\\n    *   Testing with non-integer inputs (e.g., `float`, `str`) to verify the type validation and appropriate warning messages.\\n4.  **Large Inputs**: Including tests with large values of `n` (e.g., `100,000`, `1,000,000`, `10^9`) to confirm the correctness of calculations for large numbers, particularly highlighting the arbitrary-precision integer handling in Python.\\n\\nThe `contextlib.redirect_stdout` is used in tests for invalid inputs to capture and assert the printed warning messages.\\n\\n```python\\nimport io\\nimport unittest\\nimport contextlib\\n\\n# --- Function 1: sum_of_n_natural_numbers_formula ---\\ndef sum_of_n_natural_numbers_formula(n: int) -> int:\\n    \"\"\"\\n    Calculates the sum of the first n natural numbers using the mathematical formula: n * (n + 1) / 2.\\n\\n    This method is highly efficient, providing a constant-time (O(1)) solution,\\n    making it suitable for very large values of n.
